# Detroit-Story-Map
Testing MapboxGL for data storytelling.

Text cards narrate a fly-by tour of revitalization efforts in Detroit neighborhoods. Markers on the map pop up additional media: Google street views, photos, or just text.

This is a demo showing the first several cards of a proposed story on three neighborhoods. The initial revitalization effort in the three neighborhoods, led by Invest Detroit and the City of Detroit, has been expanded to [7 addtional neighborhoods](http://theneighborhoods.org/story/130m-investments-coming-seven-detroit-neighborhoods). 

The idea to use Mapbox flyTo with text cards for storytelling was inspired by a pen by @joe-rayment
